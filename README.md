##Hyper Parameter Tuning With Hperopt Library, based on Bayesian Optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
This is Hyper parameter Tuning project with the use of HyperOpt Library which is based on Bayesian Optimization.
Algorithm use in HyperOpt is tpe.suggest.

### Data Sets Use for Experiment and Showcasing the Results

###Data
- [BankNote Authentication](/data)
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](/data)
- [Iris](/data)

###Results
- [BankNote Authentication](/BankNote_Authentication_Results)
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](/Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Results)
- [Iris](/Iris_Results)


**Note:** Above example are just used to show ability of project. You can use any other data set to find best 
Hyper parameters for that data.

## Requirements
- tensorflow
- Keras
- HyperOpt
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy

**Note:** There will few more libraries used in project implementation.
